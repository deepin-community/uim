Input method icons
==================

About this package
------------------

This project packages a collection of input method icons contributed
by scim-imengine project, uim project, and other individuals. It is
dual-licensed under 3-clause BSDL and LGPL to reduce reuse cost.

It is intended that an icon addition or update is committed to the
inputmethod-icons project first, and then imported to each input
method projects, to centralize original source repository of the
icons.

Feel free to use these icons for any projects. And we welcome new
icons contribution.

Notes
-----

- See the file 'LIST' for categorized icon list

- The icons are currently separated based on project origin as just
  aggregated. Cross-project folder categorization and uniform namings
  may be considered only if actually needed

- Creative Commons licenses was once discussed, but not adopted since
  it only brings bothering to both scim-imengine and uim
  project. Suggest again if you want
