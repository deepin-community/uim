Notes for Packagers and System Integrators
==========================================

- The option "--enable-debug" and/or "--enable-backtrace" makes uim
  (in accurately, underlying SigScheme interpreter) quite
  heavy. Please keep them unspecified for normal library

- Use the bundled SigScheme, and do not depend on external SigScheme
  package. Since the SigScheme interpreter is completely embedded into
  libuim without linking to libsscm, and exposing no
  SigScheme-specific symbols regardless of environment-dependent
  symbol exportation control existence such as -export-symbols of
  libtool or version script of ld, no conflict with libsscm occurs

- libuim links to libgcroots although SigScheme is embedded into
  libuim. Although libgcroots is also bundled in uim, it should be
  managed as a separated package since both libsscm and libuim which
  provided by separated package depends on it. Add
  '--with-libgcroots=installed' to configure options for uim to
  disable build and install of the bundled version of libgcroots

- For uim-m17nlib, the command 'uim-m17nlib-relink-icons' to import
  icons from m17n-db is provided. Run it when m17n-db has been
  updated. Whether making the command itself available for users or
  just use it as post-package-install script is the system
  integrator's choice
